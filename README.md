### Hi there 👋

I am Niklas, a BSc in Economics and Business Administration, majoring in Strategic Finance and Business Analytics. I am also taking lessons in computer science, which is a subject I have found interesting since childhood.

Outside the world of coding and technology, I focus eagerly on personal fitness. Here are some of the milestones I am proud of:
- I follow a lasting, healthy routine encompassing balanced diet, sleep and exercise.
- I've ran 3000 meters in a Cooper test.
- I do weighted pull-ups with 25 kilograms.

My main tools are Python and Excel for various purposes, such as financial modelling and data-analysis. In general, I have an intuitive understanding for all-things IT.


After graduation, I am planning to learn:

I am interested in delving into open-source and bash-scripting for a more productive workflow. I would also like to learn C to fulfil my long-term dream of a personal game project and adopt Power BI and DAX to step up my game in data analysis.
