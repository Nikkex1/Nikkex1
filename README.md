### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Niklas, a BSc in Economics and Business Administration, majoring in Strategic Finance and Business Analytics. I am also taking lessons in computer science, which is a subject I have found interesting since childhood.

Outside the world of coding and technology, I focus eagerly on personal fitness. Here are some of the milestones I am proud of:
- I follow a lasting, healthy routine encompassing balanced diet, sleep and exercise.
- I've ran 3000 meters in a Cooper test.
- I do pull-ups with 25 added kilograms.
